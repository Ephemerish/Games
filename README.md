# Games

Yo, welcome

These shall be my archive directory for the source code of my practice games

you are welcome to try and run them all. The assests and dependencies are baked with it

soo just fork and run, well as long as you are using Virtual Studio.

Any how, thank you for peeking and hope you'll have a great day!
